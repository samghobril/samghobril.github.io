Hi. My name is Sam Ghobril and I try to make stuff. I've been making iOS apps since 2012, and [Mingle](http://samghobril.com/mingle/) is my first major release.

I occasionally [write some stuff](http://samghobril.com/blog/) about whatever's on my mind (which is technology, most of the time).

I also release covers and some original music over on [SoundCloud](http://soundcloud.com/samghobril).

If you need some freelance development work, or just want to say hi, you can [drop me an email](mailto://samghobril@gmail.com) or contact me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/samghobril).
