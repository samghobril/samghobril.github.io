A little less than a month ago, I downloaded Pharrell Williams' new album G I R L, and I had this to say:

It really is a fun album. I enjoyed the upbeat, catchy riffs, and even now they can sound pretty entertaining, but the record hasn't provided me with anything other than short-lasting amusement.

Albums like Pharrell's make me skeptically excited, mostly knowing that the value of the album will soon fade, while albums like Arcade Fire's Reflektor make me curious about the contents of the album, the message behind every song, and make me feel that there's definitely more to the album than the effect of the first listen.

Good music builds my character, gives me a sense of understanding, and makes me think about the different perspectives that people have on life. It gives me the urge to inspect and really *concentrate* on the song, which causes it to get better the more I listen to it.

That's the music I'm looking for. I'm looking for innovation, not earworms. I'm looking for a lesson, a way of life, a feeling of introspection. I'm looking for art.
