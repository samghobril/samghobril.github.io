## Screen Sizes

I’ve been thinking about the newly-announced screen sizes for the iPhone, and what that means for the iOS family. The 5s/5c are still sold today, but probably won’t be in the future. So does that mean that the 4” models would just disappear?

<!-- more -->

Here’s what I’m hoping for in the future:

- iPhone Mini: 4”
- iPhone (Air?): 4.7”
- iPhone Plus: 5.5”
- iPad Mini: 7.9”
- iPad Air: 9.7”
- iPad Plus: 12.9”

Many suggested that Apple didn’t release a 4” iPhone 6 due to technical limitations. If that’s the case, and I hope it is, then I really think Apple could consider bringing back the 4” model when it’s possible again.

On another note, on Debug 46, Vicki Murley suggested that the iPad Mini has no place anymore due to it being squeezed out by the sizes of the iPhone Plus and iPad Air. I actually think the current lineup works great. People with a 5.5” model would buy the iPad Air, while people with smaller models might still opt for the iPad Mini. I guess we’ll just have to wait and see what happens.

## Apple Watch and Notifications

The Apple Watch got me thinking about the way notifications are dealt with. We’re extremely used to the idea of sound notifications. But, with the Apple Watch, how necessary are they? While wearing the Watch, we’re probably not going to miss any notifications, and we won’t need the sound to alert us if our iPhone isn’t nearby; the Watch is right there on our wrist.

And, what I’m also hoping for, is a smart, automatic way for sound notifications to get enabled/disabled on the iPhone. The Apple Watch could detect when it isn’t worn, and re-enable sounds when that happens. And vice versa.

This seems like a really minor detail, but it could potentially get us to stop thinking about the concept of putting phones on silent. I hope this exists.
