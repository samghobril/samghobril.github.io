As 2015 came along, I made a small list of things that I'd love to achieve this year, and I thought I'd share it:
## New App 1.0
This hasn't been in development for a lot of time, but I'm excited about it. I'll write more about it and maybe share a protoype video as it comes along.
## Start Video Series
I had wanted to start a podcast for a while, but after watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRofTIM1sP0) by Dave Wiskus, I got a lot more excited about starting a video series. Work on the first episode has already started, and it should hopefully be out by next week.
## Mingle 2.0
Not much information here, but this will probably be released after WWDC 2015. Probably for iOS 9.
## Read 10 books (minimum)
I love reading, but realized that I barely read any books in 2014. I think 10 books would be great if I achieve that number, and I already begun with Ed Catmull's great Creativity, Inc.
## Blog at least once a week
This is post #1 this year. ðŸ˜„
## Excercise at least twice a week
This will be the hardest. By far.
