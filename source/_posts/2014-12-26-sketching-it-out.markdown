I've been spending the last few weeks trying decide what app to build. I've already got a list of ideas that I'd like to attempt, but the problem is choosing one.

<!-- more -->

What I'd usually do is this:

- Open up Xcode
- Start building and prototyping the app idea
- Decide to carry on with the idea or discard it

This process worked, but it was tiresome. I have a little more than 40 Xcode projects that I've started, and only 3 released apps on the App Store, which says a lot about this method.

So here's what I've been doing: Sketching. I can get a pretty accurate idea about the app I'm considering making by simply putting it out of my brain and onto a piece of paper. It's faster, easier to do, and much more satisfying.

An additional bonus is that I'll end up with a neat scrapbook of my ideas later on, which is much better than a folder full of barely-worked-on Xcode projects.
